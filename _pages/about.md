Hi, I'm **Guixian Zhang**, currently a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence (Computer Science and Technology) at China University of Mining and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Guan Yuan](http://faculty.cumt.edu.cn/yuanguan/zh_CN/index.htm). Before that, I was pursuing my master's degree at Guangxi Normal University under the supervision of Prof. [Shichao Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c8G6JzIAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interest includes Data Science, Graph Learning, Trustworthy AI, Causality, and AI4S. I have published 20+ papers with total [300+ google scholar citations](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u81-9zQAAAAJ&hl). Meanwhile, I'm extra focused on AI applications in education, social networks, physics and biomedicine. I am also hobbyist in photography, cookery and football.

# 📖 History

In 1905, there were hundreds of professors renowned for their study of the universe, but it was a 26 year old Swiss patent clerk, doing physics in his spare time, who changed the world.

"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend only a little of this mystery every day. Never lose a holy curiosity."
